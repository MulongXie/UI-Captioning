# UI-Captioning

Just run `run.sh` to keep data collection running and restart the program when there is an exception.
It will create a file named `start_num.txt` to record the processed gui number.
If you are going to run a new factor and would like to start from the beginning, just delete this file.
Remember to modify `start_num` in line 366 if you delete this file and would like to change the default start number.
